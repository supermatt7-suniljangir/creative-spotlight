# Creative Spotlight

**Creative Spotlight** is my best project to date, inspired by platforms like Behance and Dribbble. It allows creators to publish and share their professional work, making it easy for others to explore and appreciate creative content. The platform stands out with its built-in messaging functionality, enabling users to contact and hire their favorite creators directly. 

Additionally, users can:
- **Like and Bookmark Projects**: Show appreciation by liking projects, and bookmark them for future reference.
- **Post New Projects**: Creators can easily upload their work without any unnecessary overhead, simplifying the process.

## Features
- **User Accounts**: Sign up and log in to manage your profile and projects.
- **Messaging**: Contact creators directly for collaboration or hiring.
- **Project Management**: Publish and manage creative work on the platform.
- **Likes and Bookmarks**: Like projects and bookmark them for easy access later.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, React Query, Material UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Storage)
- **State Management**: React Query for efficient data handling
- **Deployment**: Netlify for the frontend, Supabase for the backend
